# network_hack

USB wifi adapter that supports monitor mode is must to run the script.

This is my first basic bash script that I am uploading on github, as this was created 1 year ago by me only. This Script   can change your mac address, activate monitor mode, deactivate mode and also it can hack and jam wifi router and the devices  that are connected in the wifi router. This Script is using airmon,aircrack,aireplay and airodump tool to jam and hack wifi.  This Script is nothing but a collection of inbuilt tools in kali linux and I have just put  the tools in bash script.


Usage:-
chmod +x *
sudo bash network_hack.sh
